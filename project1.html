        <h1>Indexing Names in the 1950 Census</h1>
        <p>
          Deepen our conversion to the Savior, work as a team, and index 2,000 names.
        </p>
        <h2>How did we accomplish this goal?</h2>
        <p>
          We went to familysearch.org/getinvolved/1950 to do names for the 1950s census. When we got to a name that was difficult to read, we would send a message and ask the others if they could read it.

It is really nice to have the assurance that a set of names will be indexed by multiple people, not just your teammates. The comfort knowing that you aren't doing this alone gives you the courage to move forward. With Jesus Christ working with us, we never have to be alone.</p></div>
