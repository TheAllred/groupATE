        <h1>Become better communicators by completing Pico Park</h1>
        <p>
          The goal is to prove that we are effective communicators by playing
          Pico Park to completion.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Pico Park?</h2>
        <p>
          Pico Park is a couch-co-op game that challenges the players with a
          series of puzzels that are only possible to complete if all members of
          the team are working together.
