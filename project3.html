        <h2>How did we accomplish this goal?</h2>
        <p>
          We had a shared github repository where we would take branches off from the master, write our code, and merge it into the master branch.

If we didn't have specific things to be working on, we would often have conflicts in our code that were a mess to sort out. When we had specific files that were our own responsibility, we were able to work at full speed without conflicts.</p></div>
